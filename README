                             Digraphs for Firefox
                             (as known from Vim)


This addon brings the Vim digraphs to Firefox. After installation, you can use
Ctrl-K and a two-letter mnemonic to input many common Unicode characters.

For a detailed overview, see RFC 1345 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1345>.
This document lists all known digraphs except for "Eu"/"=e" for the Euro
currency symbol (U+20AC).


I S S U E S :

* No user configuration at the moment

* Only two-letter digraphs are recognized at the moment. The RFC also defines
  single- and multi-character mnemonics.


I N S T A L A T I O N :

* Manually: Create a text file named "digraphs@boldewyn.de" in your Firefox
  profileâ€™s "extension" folder. Its content is the absolute path to the
  digraphs@boldeyn.de folder (including the final slash). Restart Firefox.
